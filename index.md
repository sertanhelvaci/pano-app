# Privacy Policy for Pano

**Last Updated:** December 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Pano (the "App" or "Service"), a mobile application for collecting, uploading, organizing, and sharing files (similar to WeTransfer Collect), collects, uses, and protects your personal information. By using the Pano App, you agree to the practices described in this Policy.

We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:

- **Account Information:** When you create an account or sign in (e.g., via email, Apple, or Google), we collect your email address, username, and password (hashed for security).
- **Uploaded Content:** Files you upload (images, videos, documents, etc.) and their metadata (file name, size, type, upload date). We do not scan or analyze the content of your files unless required for technical reasons (e.g., virus scanning) or legal obligations.
- **Usage Data:** Device information (device type, OS version, unique device ID), IP address, approximate location (if permitted), app interactions, and analytics data.
- **Cookies and Similar Technologies:** In the App and any associated web interfaces, we use cookies, local storage, or SDKs for session management, security, and performance analytics.

We collect information directly from you, automatically through the App, or via third-party services (e.g., authentication providers).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- Provide and maintain the Service (e.g., file uploading, collection creation, link generation, downloading).
- Improve the App and develop new features.
- Ensure security and prevent fraud.
- Send service-related notifications (e.g., upload confirmations, expiration reminders).
- Comply with legal requirements.
- Anonymized analytics to understand usage patterns.

We do not sell your personal data or use uploaded file contents for marketing or training AI models.

## 3. Sharing Your Information

We share information only in limited circumstances:

- With service providers (e.g., cloud storage like AWS, analytics tools like Google Analytics) under strict data processing agreements.
- With recipients of your shared links (only the link provides access to files).
- In response to legal requests (e.g., court orders).
- In the event of a business transfer (merger, acquisition).

File contents are encrypted in transit and at rest, and accessible only via your generated links.

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

- Uploaded files are stored temporarily (e.g., until the collection expires or is deleted, typically 30 days or as set by you).
- Personal data is retained only as long as necessary for the Service or legal requirements.
- Upon account deletion, we delete or anonymize your data, subject to backups and legal holds.

We use industry-standard security measures, including encryption (TLS/SSL), access controls, and regular audits. However, no system is 100% secure.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices

You may:

- Access, correct, or delete your personal data via the App settings.
- Withdraw consent for optional features (e.g., location).
- Opt out of non-essential analytics.
- Request data export or deletion by contacting us.

For users in the EU/UK (GDPR) or California (CCPA/CPRA), additional rights apply, such as data portability and non-discrimination.

## 6. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for users under 16 years old. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## 7. International Data Transfers

Data may be processed in countries outside your residence (e.g., servers in the EU or US). We ensure adequate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses).

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy. Significant changes will be notified via the App or email. Continued use constitutes acceptance.
