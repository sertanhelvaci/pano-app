### File Uploads & Collections

**What types of files can I upload?**
You can upload various file types including images, videos, documents, and more. Check the app for specific file type restrictions and size limits.

**How long are my files stored?**
Files and collections expire automatically after 30 days by default. You can extend this period or delete files manually at any time.

**How do I create a collection?**
Tap the "+" button in the app, select files from your device, and create a new collection. You can name and organize your collection as needed.

**Can I add more files to an existing collection?**
Yes, you can add files to existing collections by opening the collection and using the "Add Files" option.

### Sharing & Links

**How do I share my files?**
Once you've created a collection, tap the "Share" button to generate a shareable link. You can copy the link and send it to others via email, messaging apps, or any method you prefer.

**Who can access my shared links?**
Anyone with the link can access the files in that collection. Keep your links private and only share them with people you trust.

**Can I set a password for my shared links?**
Check the app settings for password protection options. If available, you can add an extra layer of security to your shared collections.

**How do I revoke access to a shared link?**
You can delete the collection or remove individual files from your account. Once deleted, the link will no longer work.

### Privacy & Security

**Is my data secure?**
Yes, we use industry-standard encryption (TLS/SSL) to protect your files both in transit and at rest. Your files are only accessible via the links you generate.

**Do you scan or analyze my files?**
We do not scan or analyze the content of your files unless required for technical reasons (e.g., virus scanning) or legal obligations. Your privacy is important to us.
